                As an ordinary modern individual with severely deteriorating memory for various complex reasons, I have
                been fixated on all acts of "capturing" things that are "volatile" these days. This obsession is
                manifested most prominently in thoughts and texts that are inherently fragile. </br></br>

                Have you ever felt that thoughts are like cigarette smoke? Although I may not be able to organize them,
                as someone who takes pride in the act of emanating thoughts, I often have various random thoughts. And
                it is from these scattered thoughts that interesting ideas usually arise. To create a central point from
                this muddled state of random thoughts, it is necessary to capture and refine them. However, it has
                always been disappointing that thoughts, like cigarette smoke, disappear quickly without even giving me
                a chance to hold onto them. </br></br>

                To compensate for this, I have made a lot of effort personally. I try to develop my thoughts as if I
                were solving a puzzle (establishing cause and effect, storytelling), structure them in real-time by
                adding numbering or indexing (depth), make note-taking a habit, and constantly strive to record
                everything I want to remember. I spent a period of time focusing on the act of prolonging the residual
                time of thoughts and concentrating on recording them. </br></br>

                However, even with these efforts, I didn't feel fulfilled. So I woke up and looked back...

                Sketchbooks, calendars, notebooks, and scattered sticky notes everywhere need not be mentioned. My
                memos, too, were scattered across various platforms amidst the sovereignty battle of different
                applications—OneNote, sticker memos, whiteboards, iCloud Notes, Notion, Pigment Jam, and more. Even
                within each platform, individual thoughts were trapped in separate text boxes, arranged in chronological
                order of their creation time. No wonder scattered past thoughts are merely preserved as records, unable
                to be anything more.

                However, there must be some of those memos that are related to each other, share common themes, or, if
                lucky, critique or complement one another. </br></br>

                And recently...! I have been feeling that my thoughts are increasingly interconnected. There are many
                instances where conclusions reached in one situation align with previous scribbled thoughts, where
                similar keywords are shared among thoughts, and where momentary attempts to link to something in my
                long-term memory are abundant... The problem is that the malleability of my brain doesn't offer much
                assistance.

            This is a series of linking processes that have been happening in my endeavor to capture²⁾. On March 1st,
            while reading an article about places and the loss of place, a particular sentence sparked a sense of
            familiarity. I spent nearly 10 minutes pondering, and eventually realized that the source of the familiarity
            was the book "Artworks in the Technological Reproduction Era." I then spent another 2 minutes searching for
            where I had jotted down notes from that book. Fortunately, I remembered roughly when I read the sentence,
            and thanks to the fact that I had been capturing all book-related notes in my capturing device for the past
            two weeks, finding page D6 wasn't a significant challenge. Once I arrived at D6, I noticed traces of another
            failed attempt to find a link with "Visual Culture." It was clearly a problem. </br></br>

            <i>2. *Capturing Device (機) = An apparatus that aids in capturing; parasitic on Google Sheets; falls into
                the
                category of daily necessities along with washing machines, recorders, and hair dryers.</i> </br></br>

            The conclusion of this long journey was that creating a second brain to replace my rigid neural plasticity
            was urgently needed. Luckily, as part of the UI Programming Design course I'm taking this semester, I was
            able to implement Na Huiyeon's Spare Brain to some extent.

                Just as there is an idiomatic expression that thoughts twist and turn like a tail, for a singular
                thought to transition into the realm of cognition, there must be continuity and connectivity between
                each thought. Only then can deep thinking occur, even if it takes several weeks to delve into. And
                sometimes, when unrelated thoughts are connected, ingenious ideas often emerge. At least that's the case
                for me. </br></br>

                Now, let's bring in a quote from neuroscientist Jeong Jaeseung, who can be summoned almost by
                forgetting.¹⁾</br></br>

                <i>1. I can't find where I originally wrote it. It's driving me crazy.</i></br></br>
                "Creativity and humor are the creation of connections between distant groups of memories in the brain's
                circuits. The better you do this, the more successful humor you have."</br>

                Jaeseung Jeong</br></br>

                Furthermore, I have come to the belief that it is important to preserve the context of these connections
                in order to fully reflect on them later. </br></br>

                <b>There have been similar attempts, haven't there...</b> </br></br>

                <b>'tag'</b></br></br>
                'tag' is a form of metadata, structured data that describes other data. In familiar platforms like
                Notion and other databases, keyword tags are frequently used to sort content. We often attach
                multiple tags related to the attributes of a single piece of data and then classify the data
                based on these tags. The organized data tables are then grouped under subcategories of tags
                (data set → data set (classified)).</br></br>

            One of the recent discoveries I made about Notion is its feature of syncable text boxes. It
            allows the same data to be embedded in multiple pages and managed collectively.</br></br>

            By using this block as a mediator, scattered memos can implement the connectivity shared
            individually between disjointed pages. Well, it can be utilized for that purpose. However,
            it doesn't seem suitable for finding the connectivity of existing data, as it requires
            retroactive synchronization of partial data. The most critical drawback is... Notion
            inherently displays one page at a time in a single window, making it difficult to see at a
            glance how things are connected and linked.</br></br>

            <b>'Are.na_channel'</b></br></br>

            It's an interesting program that tackles similar needs in a slightly different
            direction.</br></br>

            Here, they use the term "channel." Users create a channel with a specific topic and
            create memo boxes within the channel's sub-hierarchy. However, it's different from the
            grouping created by tags. Through the act of collecting in the channel, connections
            between memos can be established, as well as connections with other users' memos. In the
            end, it creates an... endless reference point... where you can create a link tree.</br></br>

            <b>The question is, is it about classifying or linking? Grouping or tying?</b></br></br>

            The answer is linking and tying, ultimately leading to clustering.</br></br>

            Rather than the hierarchy of tags, the following familiar passage seems more appropriate
            to me.</br></br>

            "A monkey's buttocks are red.
            If it's red, it's an apple. Apples are delicious.
            If it's delicious, it's a banana. Bananas are long.
            If it's long, it's a train. Trains are fast.
            If it's fast, it's an airplane. Airplanes are high.
            If it's high, it's Mount Baekdu."</br></br>
            <figure>
                <img src="https://blush-print-044.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F84ba1140-63a6-4351-8d85-4bb38b726352%2FUntitled.png?id=3e4202fb-fa7c-4de3-a8ce-592f8aed200e&table=block&spaceId=db1dc395-061b-4962-941e-c367ef169eb2&width=2000&userId=&cache=v2"

                <figcaption>They do have intersections...!</figcaption>
            </figure>

            If we assume that the objects continuing in the lyrics of the song "A monkey's buttocks
            are red" are nodes and the shared attributes are links, we can create a network on the
            right. In the passage until "A monkey's buttocks are red, if it's red, it's an apple,"
            the monkey's buttocks and the apple have a one-to-one relationship in the network. When
            we read until "Apples are delicious, if it's delicious, it's a banana," the apple is
            connected to the monkey's buttocks and the banana in a one-to-many (1:N) relationship.
            As more datasets are added, a many-to-many (N:M) network of relationships will grow,
            eventually forming clusters.</br></br>

            <b>First Prototype</b>
            The first prototype focused on developing two key functions. The key functions are as
            follows:</br></br>

            Function 1: Showing the intersection that already exists.</br></br>

            Visualize the intersections between related memos. The relevance is extracted through
            text analysis.</br></br>

            When Memo Box A is clicked, other boxes related to A are connected by lines.
            Specifically visualizing which words or sentences are connected has not been
            implemented. Just a rough idea.</br></br>

            Function 2: Recommending/creating the intersection that doesn't exist.</br></br>

            Create the connectivity between unrelated keyword boxes using ChatGPT. Actually, this
            one is an extra feature, but it's interesting, so I included it.</br></br>

            Drag and overlap unrelated keyword boxes A and B.
            Click on the popup question mark icon, and you'll receive ChatGPT's response to the
            question, "How can { A } and { B } be connected?"
            It's not particularly creative, but it's funny. The example below shows ChatGPT
            recommending "a bird using laundry left outside as a nest" as a connection between
            laundry and birds.</br></br>

            This concludes the work done in the UI Programming Design class up to the midterm.
            Currently, I am working on implementing this in JavaScript. There have been some
            eliminations/modifications due to technical issues, which I will explain in the next
            episode. I'm also studying hypertext-related topics, which I plan to organize at some
            point. Except for the final project, everything is fun.
