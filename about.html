                    As an ordinary modern individual with severely deteriorating memory for various complex reasons, I have been fixated on all acts of "capturing" things that are "volatile" these days. This obsession is manifested most prominently in thoughts and texts that are inherently fragile. </br></br>

                    Have you ever felt that thoughts are like cigarette smoke? Although I may not be able to organize them, as someone who takes pride in the act of emanating thoughts, I often have various random thoughts. And it is from these scattered thoughts that interesting ideas usually arise. To create a central point from this muddled state of random thoughts, it is necessary to capture and refine them. However, it has always been disappointing that thoughts, like cigarette smoke, disappear quickly without even giving me a chance to hold onto them. </br></br>

                    To compensate for this, I have made a lot of effort personally. I try to develop my thoughts as if I were solving a puzzle (establishing cause and effect, storytelling), structure them in real-time by adding numbering or indexing (depth), make note-taking a habit, and constantly strive to record everything I want to remember. I spent a period of time focusing on the act of prolonging the residual time of thoughts and concentrating on recording them. </br></br>

                    However, even with these efforts, I didn't feel fulfilled. So I woke up and looked back...

                    I was dealing with a mess of wombat droppings.¹ </br></br>

                    1. Wombat droppings are square-shaped. </br></br>

                    Sketchbooks, calendars, notebooks, and scattered sticky notes everywhere need not be mentioned. My memos, too, were scattered across various platforms amidst the sovereignty battle of different applications—OneNote, sticker memos, whiteboards, iCloud Notes, Notion, Pigment Jam, and more. Even within each platform, individual thoughts were trapped in separate text boxes, arranged in chronological order of their creation time. No wonder scattered past thoughts are merely preserved as records, unable to be anything more.

                    However, there must be some of those memos that are related to each other, share common themes, or, if lucky, critique or complement one another. </br></br>

                    And recently...! I have been feeling that my thoughts are increasingly interconnected. There are many instances where conclusions reached in one situation align with previous scribbled thoughts, where similar keywords are shared among thoughts, and where momentary attempts to link to something in my long-term memory are abundant... The problem is that the malleability of my brain doesn't offer much assistance.

                    This is a series of linking processes that have been happening in my endeavor to capture²⁾. On March 1st, while reading an article about places and the loss of place, a particular sentence sparked a sense of familiarity. I spent nearly 10 minutes pondering, and eventually realized that the source of the familiarity was the book "Artworks in the Technological Reproduction Era." I then spent another 2 minutes searching for where I had jotted down notes from that book. Fortunately, I remembered roughly when I read the sentence, and thanks to the fact that I had been capturing all book-related notes in my capturing device for the past two weeks, finding page D6 wasn't a significant challenge. Once I arrived at D6, I noticed traces of another failed attempt to find a link with "Visual Culture." It was clearly a problem. </br></br>

                    *Capturing Device (機) = An apparatus that aids in capturing; parasitic on Google Sheets; falls into the category of daily necessities along with washing machines, recorders, and hair dryers. </br></br>

                    The conclusion of this long journey was that creating a second brain to replace my rigid neural plasticity was urgently needed. Luckily, as part of the UI Programming Design course I'm taking this semester, I was able to implement Na Huiyeon's Spare Brain to some extent.

                    Just as there is an idiomatic expression that thoughts twist and turn like a tail, for a singular thought to transition into the realm of cognition, there must be continuity and connectivity between each thought. Only then can deep thinking occur, even if it takes several weeks to delve into. And sometimes, when unrelated thoughts are connected, ingenious ideas often emerge. At least that's the case for me.

                    Now, let's bring in a quote from neuroscientist Jeong Jaeseung, who can be summoned almost by forgetting.¹⁾

                    1. I can't find where I originally wrote it. It's driving me crazy.
                    "Creativity and humor are the creation of connections between distant groups of memories in the brain's circuits. The better you do this, the more successful humor you have."

                    Jaeseung Jeong
                    Furthermore, I have come to the belief that it is important to preserve the context of these connections in order to fully reflect on them later.

                    There have been similar attempts, haven't there...

                    <tag>
                    <tag> is a form of metadata, structured data that describes other data. In familiar platforms like Notion and other databases, keyword tags are frequently used to sort content. We often attach multiple tags related to the attributes of a single piece of data and then classify the data based on these tags. The organized data tables are then grouped under subcategories of tags (data set → data set (classified)).

                    Please translate the above passage into English.
